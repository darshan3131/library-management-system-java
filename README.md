A console-based **Library Management System** built with **pure Core Java**. This intermediate-level project models a real-world library with books, members, issuing/returning books, and searching functionality.

It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming** principles deeply: multiple related classes, **inheritance** (different member types with varying borrow limits), **polymorphism** (treating subclasses uniformly), encapsulation, and collections.


## 🚀 Features

- 📖 **Add Books** – Register new books with title, author, and unique ISBN  
- 👥 **Register Members** – Support for Student (max 5 books) and Faculty (max 10 books) members  
- 📤 **Issue Books** – Borrow a book if available and member hasn't reached limit  
- 📥 **Return Books** – Return borrowed books and update availability  
- 🔍 **Search Books** – By title or author (case-insensitive partial match)  
- 📋 **View All Books & Members** – List with status (available/borrowed) and borrowed details  
- 🛡️ **Validation** – Prevents invalid operations (e.g., issuing unavailable book, exceeding limits)  
- 🧬 **OOP Showcase** – Inheritance & polymorphism via member types with different rules
